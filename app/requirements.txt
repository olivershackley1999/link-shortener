# requirements.txt — Python packages this app needs.
# When Docker builds the image, it runs "pip install -r requirements.txt"
# to install these into the container.
#
# flask:     The web framework (handles routes, requests, responses)
# psycopg2-binary: The PostgreSQL driver for Python (lets Python talk to Postgres)
#   The "-binary" version comes pre-compiled so you don't need to install
#   system-level build tools in the container. Saves time and image size.
# gunicorn:  A production-grade WSGI server (explained below in the Dockerfile)
flask==3.1.0
psycopg2-binary==2.9.10
